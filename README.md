## Installation

Install pygame by typing "pip install pygame" or pip3 install pygame.

## Notice
i do not own most of the Flappy Bird assets, or the Flappy Bird name, some of the assets were extracted straight from the game. They are the work and copyright of original creator Dong Nguyen and .GEARS games (http://www.dotgears.com/).

I took this Tweet (https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/431060041009856512 / http://i.imgur.com/AcyWyqf.png) by Dong Nguyen, the creator of the game, as an open invitation to reuse the game concept and assets in an open source project. There is no intention to steal the game, or claim the Flappy Bird name as my own.

If the copyright holder would like for the assets to be removed, please open an issue to start the conversation.
